The Tuidang Movement is a political campaign operated by the Epoch Times that aims to destroy the Communist Party of China (CPC).

# Illegitimacy of the movement
The Tuidang Movement claims that 300,000,000+ people have quit the CPC.

In a response to Daniel W. Drezner, Stephen Gregory from the Epoch Times said that deceased CPC members can quit, ex-CPC members can also "tuidang", assumed names were also counted. This indicates that one can put names of other people and that the Tuidang Movement is unsure about the legitimacy of the names. 

There is a lack of corroborating sources. Daniel W. Drezner wrote on Foreign Policy that he couldn't find any non-Epoch Times report on the campaign. https://foreignpolicy.com/2005/03/15/can-200000-chinese-ex-communists-be-wrong/

The Epoch Times and associated organizations did not provide any evidence to enable to verification of their claim. Furthermore, it is likely that the Tuidang Movement does not have the capability of verifying the submitted names.

# Effects of the movement
Falun Gong protests have used the Tuidang Movement to promote their cause. However, the number of CPC members continues to grow normally.

# Fake names
An article on Minghui (Falun Gong website) written by a FLG practicioner even said: there are duplicate names, several people named "smooth", "peace", "little Hong", "elder brother", "brother 2", "brother 3", "brother 4", "brother 5", "brother 6", "brother 7", ..., "elder Ping", "second Ping", "third Ping", ..., "rice", "beans", and other funny names. It reduces the credibility of the "tuidang" a lot. And the names were still probably included in the count. (《三退起名要认真对待》https://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2008/1/22/170833.html)

# False cases
## Former party secretary of the China Writers Association

Chinese media said that Meng Weizai said he was angry when he heard about this "resignation from the party", and wrote a letter denying it.
> Meng Weizai, was a CPC member, I am a CPC member and I will be a CPC member until I die.  I will never betray the great Chinese Communist Party!

https://web.archive.org/web/20070224140356/http://www.phoenixtv.com/phoenixtv/72931714371944448/20050228/510382.shtml

The Epoch Times responded, saying that Meng Weizai said he indeed withdrew, and that Xinhua fabricated his denial. "Professor Ming" said:
> A few days later, we hear more things coming out, saying that he personally made an announcement that “New China News Agency fabricated that announcement, I did not say that. I did withdraw from the Party.” (source: https://web.archive.org/web/20051123061111/http://washingtonchinareview.com/newsdetail.php?id=2263）

The Epoch Times also said that there were grammatical errors in Meng Weizai's letter.

However, The Epoch Times and its allies are wrong

1. "Professor Ming" relies on hearsay, without even mentioning its origins. He does not explain how he got the information. These sources of information are not verifiable.
2. Grammatical errors can happen anytime and do not necessarily prove that a letter is false
3. There is a video of the interview with Meng Weizai, in which is refuted these "Tuidang" claims. It is difficult to make a fake video, but the interview could be forced. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPDe-wToLBg
4. It is not forced. The claim of "Meng Weizai quitting the party" come from an account on forum claiming to be Meng Weizai. After Meng Weizai was interviewed, the account implied that this interview was forced. If it was forced, Meng Weizai would not be able to publish more anti-CPC content on this account. In conclusion, the account is an impersonator.

Also, on Baidu (https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AD%9F%E4%BC%9F%E5%93%89/636226), it is stated that Meng Weizai finished writing a patriotic novel (昨天的战争) about the Korean War in 2000. Therefore, it is unlikely that he will be against the Communist Party. On another Chinese website (https://www.gdcenn.cn/zt/20110704/), it is shown that Meng Weizai participated in an event celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Communist Party of China. The 90th anniversary was in 2011. Therefore, it is even more unlikely that he would have quit the party.

## 50 old comrades
Arricles by Boxun and Yuming Net (https://news.boxun.com/news/gb/pubvp/2004/12/200412281433.shtml, http://yuming.qxbbs.org/NEWS/cat10_9/2004-12/1104232171.html) claim that Meng Weizai and 50 old comrades quit the party. While we have demonstrated that Meng Weizai's alleged resignation is likely false, what about the others?

The names are 邓力群、余秋雨、郑伯农、周良沛、陈涌、柯岩、魏传统、李尔重、朱仲丽、王季青、王泽民、李真、华楠、张常海、栗栖、彭绪一、邓斌、欧阳山、张器友、贺敬之、徐肖冰、胡可、瞿维、胡朋、钱丹辉、魏巍、朱子奇、陆梅林、刘绍棠、程代熙、刘朝兰、麦辛、江波、陈志昂、潘仁山、柳萌、郑永惠、栾保俊、刘金、刘梦溪、方家文、刘荣庭、梵扬、楼栖、徐乐义、黎洪、陶有法、贾文昭、侯波、马文瑞.

The problem is that, in this list of alleged resignations, there are people who were already deceased at the time of the publication of this statement.

魏传统 died in 1996，刘绍棠 died in 1997，程代熙 died in 1999，欧阳山 died in 2000，瞿维 died in 2002，马文瑞 died in 2004。

Most of these people are staunch communists, and very old. It is unlikely that they would quit the party.

For example, Deng Liqun was congratulating Xinjiang martyrs in a message to the Communist Party of China.

# Vietnam falsely attributed to China
In a page of "9binh" (Tuidang website in Vietnamese) (https://9binh.com/support/huong-dan-tam-thoai.html), it is shown that someone is claiming to quit the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) on The Epoch Times' Tuidang website for the Communist Party of China. This indicates that the alleged number of people who quit the Communist Party of China may include some who allegedly quit the Communist Party of Vietnam.
