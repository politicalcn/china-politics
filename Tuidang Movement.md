The Tuidang Movement is a political campaign operated by the Epoch Times that aims to destroy the Communist Party of China (CPC).

# Legitimacy of the movement
The Tuidang Movement claims that 300,000,000+ people have quit the CPC.

Stephen Gregory from the Epoch Times claimed that assumed names of ex-CPC members were also counted. This indicates that one can put names of other people and that the Tuidang Movement is unsure about the legitimacy of the names. Daniel W. Drezner wrote on Foreign Policy that he couldn't find any non-Epoch Times report on the campaign. https://foreignpolicy.com/2005/03/15/can-200000-chinese-ex-communists-be-wrong/

The Epoch Times and associated organizations did not provide any evidence to enable to verification of their claim. Furthermore, it is likely that the Tuidang Movement does not have the capability of verifying the submitted names.

# Effects of the movement
Falun Gong protests have used the Tuidang Movement to promote their cause. However, the number of CPC members continues to grow.
