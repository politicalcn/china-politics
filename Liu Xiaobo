Liu Xiaobo was an anti-government activist in China.

He praised the US invasion of Iraq

> [T]he outstanding achievement made by Bush in anti-terrorism absolutely cannot be erased by Kerry's slandering â€¦ However much risk must be endured in striking down Saddam Hussein, know that no action would lead to a greater risk. This has been proven by the second world war and September 11! No matter what, the war against Saddam Hussein is just! The decision by President Bush is right!

He criticised Chinese culture:

> If I were to make this I would show just how wimpy, spineless and fucked-up [weisuo, ruanruo, caodan] the Chinese really are

He supported colonialism:

> It took Hong Kong 100 years to become what it is. Given the size of China, certainly it would need 300 years of colonisation for it to become like what Hong Kong is today. I even doubt whether 300 years would be enough.
