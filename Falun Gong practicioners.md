# Ipswich threat
A letter from a Falun Gong practicioner was sent to the Ipswich city council. It read:

> "If you help his cause, he will plant a wheel in your stomach, which protects you from any harm or illness,"

> "And if you don't listen to me, Master Li will also use his power to punish you."

> "I don't think you will let that happen."

> "Please write back to me otherwise I will report to Master Li."

> "Your council must bought (sic) by the evil red dragon," (the Communist Party of China)
