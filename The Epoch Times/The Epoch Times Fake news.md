In an article, The Epoch Times, a Falun-Gong affiliated media, claims that rejecting the Communist Party of China can cure COVID-19, and supporting the party will have the opposite effect.

> "These true stories tell us that one’s understanding of and attitude toward the CCP will determine whether he or she is immune to the CCP virus. Rejecting and condemning the CCP is an effective cure to the CCP virus. Conversely, supporting the CCP, endorsing the CCP, or establishing a close partnership with the CCP, will likely invite the CCP virus. Some may even experience a relapse if they choose to side with the CCP. [...] If someone is unfortunately infected with the CCP virus, we suggest that you sincerely say  “down with the CCP demons.” Maybe a miracle will happen." The Epoch Times article (archive):
