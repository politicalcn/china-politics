There are at least 4 "China Democracy Parties" in the US.
 - CDPWU (CDP World Union), led by Wang Jun
 - HQCDP (CDP Headquarters), led by Xie Wanjun

According to the "China Democracy and Justice Party", in 2006, a lady was committing immigration fraud under the name of "China Democracy", tarnishing the image of Wang Jun's party, and Xie Wanjun's party was doing such activities. Refund was demanded for Xie Wanjun's immigration scam. Xie Wanjun (leader of the "China Democracy Party Headquarters") called Wang Jun (leader of the "China Democracy Party World Alliance") a "CCP agent". At the end of the article, Wang Jun also suspected that Xie Wanjun was serving the Chinese communists.
