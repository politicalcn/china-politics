# Lawsuit of Falun Gong practicioners
In 2021, the court agreed with the CACWA's stance on Falun Gong's teachings. The court also ruled that religious protection doesn't apply to Falun Gong protest sites, allowing the CACWA to do counter-protests.
> Defendants object, for instance, to Falun Gong teachings that followers should not take medication for illness, that aliens have visited earth, and that the heavens are divided into racial zones and a person of a mixed racial background will â€˜go to the heaven that belongs to the race of his Main Spirit.'
