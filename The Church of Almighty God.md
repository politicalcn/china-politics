'The Church of Almighty God' is a religious group founded in China. It is a dangerous cult.

# Cult characteristics of The Church of Almighty God
The Church of the Almighty God (CAG) can be considered a cult for the following reasons:

**The group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display excessively zealous, unquestioning commitment**: The CAG believes that Jesus returned as a woman from China. According to Holly Folk, an associate professor at Western Washington University who has been studying the CAG since 2016, “They have their own narrative for how the apocalypse is going to happen, and they have their own scripture. They don’t see the Bible as the literal word of God but as a human document that has flaws in its teaching,”  “The literal word of God is the recorded recitations of Almighty God, their leader who lives in Flushing, Queens.” https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/twitter-israel-election-suspensions

**The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members in an aggressive way**: The group is reported to be ‘highly aggressive’ (CFAR n.d.a) and uses ‘strongarm’ tactics to recruit followers (The New York Times 19 Dec. 2012; SCMP 17 Dec. 2012). According to several sources, the Church of Almighty God tries to convert members from other Christian groups. Two sources indicate that the group has published a manual on how to convert other Christians (Shanghaiist 20 Dec. 2012; CFAR n.d.a). Sources report that some Christian groups have accused members of the Church of Almighty God of attempts to infiltrate their own groups (UCANews 20 Dec. 2012; SCMP 18 Dec. 2012).

# Dangerous behavior

Both the Chinese government and Chinese Christian organizations have accused the CAG of kidnapping people.

> 'On April 16, 2002, thirty four top leaders of China Gospel Fellowship (CGF) were kidnapped by the Eastern Lightning Cult (the EL) who claimed to be from the Singapore Haggai Leadership Institute, in the name of leadership training. This event has caused great concern among fellow Christians both in and outside of China.' http://www.chinaforjesus.com/cgf/070702/index.htm

> 'Linked to kidnappings, violence and extortion, the group has been listed among 14 banned religious groups by China’s Ministry of Public Security since 1995.' 
https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/06/world/asia/china-eastern-lightning-killing/index.html

The CAG denied the CGF kidnapping incident. It published a five-point statement in order to prove its points. The Asia Research Society published a rebuttal to the CAG's statement, and demonstrated that the CAG's arguments denying the kidnapping were wrong. You can read the rebuttal here: http://www.asiaresearchcenter.org/static/media/AH%20rebuttal%20416_Eng.4464a6d8.pdf.

The CAG has also been accused of spreading unethical values. A victim of the cult said:

> "The cult is anti-family, anti-human, anti-government. It is constantly training its members to lie to their husbands and wives. They throw away family relationships and encourage each other to do the same. [...] Whoever is more resolute in rejecting their family is given a higher rank. It takes people who are kind and makes them crazy and extreme."

There has been many reports and accusations of people harmed by the CAG. However, I won't write them here because it will be too complicated. You can search them on the China Anti-Cult Association or on various English news channels.

# Heresy

The CAG has many heretical beliefs that are incompatible with Christianity.

For example, the CAG rejects the Bible's holiness and instead believes in their "female Jesus". Its website states: "It is nothing more than a historical record of God's work, and a testament to the previous two stages of God's work, and offers you no understanding of the aims of God's work”.

You can read more, on the website called 'China For Jesus', that exposed many of the CAG's lies. http://www.chinaforjesus.com/resources/exel/contentsch.htm

# Dishonest recruitment tactics

Online, there are many accounts with fake names trying to advertise the CAG (especially on Facebook). These account appear to be unrelated to the CAG, but use subtle techniques to recruit people. The CAG has also created many many websites. Below are some of the websites propagating the message of the CAG:
- holyspiritspeaks.org - "Gospel of the Descent of the Kingdom"
- easternlightning.org - ""
- hearthymn.com - "Walk in The Light"
- godfootsteps.org - "The Church of Almighty God"
- kingdomsalvation.org
- rainbowtoken.com
- testifygod.org - "Testify God"
- lesalut.org - "Bible en ligne"
- luciolededieu.org - "L'Évangile de Dieu"
- pursuestar.com - "追逐晨星."
- en.msa-it.org - "Stella del matino" Via Angelo Brunetti 8, 20156 Milano MI
- cagnz.org - "Gospel of the Descent of the Kingdom"
- thechurchofdawnlight.org - "The Church of Dawn's Light" - 35-05 162nd Street, Flushing, NY 11358
The amount of websites with very different names and URL adresses may be a sign of the CAG's dishonest recruitment tactics. Beware of them.

# International condemnation

Christians in Hong Kong condemn the CAG. They have been harassed by the CAG.

The NBCC, in India, is the highest church body in Nagaland and has condemned the CAG. Part of the letter read:

> The cult teaches that Jesus/God has come back to Earth as a woman, named Yang Xiangbin, also called Lightning Deng, and the New Testament has been replaced by their new bible, called ‘The Word Appears in the Flesh [...] Jesus said in his word that he would return to Earth, not as the Almighty who speaks through a woman from China, but as he was, is and shall ever be. Let us beware of this dangerous cult as they are actively spreading a false gospel and false teachings

Korean churches have condemned the CAG as a cult. Followers of the cult abuse the refugee law of Korea.

http://www.hdjongkyo.co.kr/news/view.html?section=22&category=1004&no=17414

The "Families of victims of the Chinese pseudo-religion Almighty God" was held in Korea by various Christian and anti-cult groups, to denounce the cult of CAG.

The evangelist John Haggai said:

> Chinese government officials did what they could to bring a successful conclusion to this felonious activity.

The Haggai Institute wrote:

> The worldwide staff and alumni of Haggai Institute are distressed and disturbed that H.I.’s name was used to perpetrate the kidnapping of the 34 leaders of the China Gospel Fellowship. None of our staff or faculty was involved in any way. We have had no known contact with members of the Eastern Lightning cult.
