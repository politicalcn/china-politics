The Church of Almighty God is a religious group in China. It is considered a cult by the Chinese government.

# Cult characteristics
The group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display excessively zealous, unquestioning commitment: The CAG believes that Jesus returned as a woman from China. According to Holly Folk, an associate professor at Western Washington University who has been studying the CAG since 2016, “They have their own narrative for how the apocalypse is going to happen, and they have their own scripture. They don’t see the Bible as the literal word of God but as a human document that has flaws in its teaching,”  “The literal word of God is the recorded recitations of Almighty God, their leader who lives in Flushing, Queens.” https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/twitter-israel-election-suspensions 
The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members: The group is reported to be ‘highly aggressive’ (CFAR n.d.a) and uses ‘strongarm’ tactics to recruit followers (The New York Times 19 Dec. 2012; SCMP 17 Dec. 2012). According to several sources, the Church of Almighty God tries to convert members from other Christian groups (UCANews 20 Dec. 2012; Shanghaiist 20 De c. 2012; CFAR n.d.a). Two sources indicate that the group has published a manual on how to convert other Christians (Shanghaiist 20 Dec. 2012; CFAR n.d.a). Sources report that some Christian groups have accused members of the Church of Almighty God of attempts to infiltrate their own groups (UCANews 20 Dec. 2012; SCMP 18 Dec. 2012).
# Dangerous behavior
Both the Chinese government and Chinese Christian organizations have accused the CAG of kidnapping people.
'On April 16, 2002, thirty four top leaders of China Gospel Fellowship (CGF) were kidnapped by the Eastern Lightning Cult (the EL) who claimed to be from the Singapore Haggai Leadership Institute, in the name of leadership training. This event has caused great concern among fellow Christians both in and outside of China.' http://www.chinaforjesus.com/cgf/070702/index.htm 
'Linked to kidnappings, violence and extortion, the group has been listed among 14 banned religious groups by China’s Ministry of Public Security since 1995.' https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/06/world/asia/china-eastern-lightning-killing/index.html
