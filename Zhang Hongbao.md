Zhang Hongbao (张宏堡) is the leader of the banned Zhong Gong cult.

Nan Fang He, Zhang Hongbao's housekeeper, accused Zhang of slapping and hitting her, pounding her against a wooden chair during a dispute, holding against her will in a bedroom, making sexual advances towards her 20 year-old daughter. She also said that Zhang was fascinated by leaders and power and that Zhang's house was decorated with luxuries amd gold.

Zhang was charged with crimes such as kidnapping. He said they were part of a Chinese communist conspiracy.

Even the Falun Gong leader Li Hongzhi, in his book Zhuan Falun, called him a "sham qi gong master". https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/073100china-leader.html
