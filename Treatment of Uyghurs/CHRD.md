Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) published a document titled "China: Massive Numbers of Uyghurs & Other Ethnic Minorities Forced into Re-education Programs".

The conclusion is that 30% of villagers are involuntarily sent to re-education camps.

However, CHRD only relies on interviews with 8 Xinjiang residents and words of Zhang Yun, a Chinese official.

> As an example, in one village, 70% of [Uyghur Muslims] influenced by religion are swept along by religious extremists, about 30% of the masses are polluted by religious extremist forces, and a very small minority of them have become criminals, … The 70% group go with the general [political] climate, so there’s no need to do much work on them, [since] when the general climate changes, it is very easy to swing them; and the masses in **the 30% need to be educated and reformed through concentrated force**. The third kind [a small minority of criminals] must be struck down. Release the 70% who just go along, reform the 30%, strike down hard on the very small minority, then, a village will be more or less cleaned up.

There source cited for Zhang Yun's words is a dead link.

Assuming that he indeed spoke those words, "30% of the masses are polluted by extremist forces" is possibly a unprecise guess. Furthermore, the term "concentrated force" may be figurative and "reeducation" may be only a campaign to raise public awareness.
