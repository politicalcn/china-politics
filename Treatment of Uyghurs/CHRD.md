Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) published a document titled "China: Massive Numbers of Uyghurs & Other Ethnic Minorities Forced into Re-education Programs".

The conclusion is that 30% of villagers are involuntarily sent to re-education camps.

However, CHRD only relies on interviews with 8 Xinjiang residents and words of Zhang Yun, a Chinese official.

> As an example, in one village, 70% of [Uyghur Muslims] influenced by religion are swept along by religious extremists, about 30% of the masses are polluted by religious extremist forces, and a very small minority of them have become criminals, … The 70% group go with the general [political] climate, so there’s no need to do much work on them, [since] when the general climate changes, it is very easy to swing them; and the masses in **the 30% need to be educated and reformed through concentrated force**. The third kind [a small minority of criminals] must be struck down. Release the 70% who just go along, reform the 30%, strike down hard on the very small minority, then, a village will be more or less cleaned up.

There source cited for Zhang Yun's words is a dead link.

Assuming that he indeed spoke those words, "30% of the masses are polluted by extremist forces" is possibly a unprecise guess. Furthermore, the term "concentrated force" may be figurative and "reeducation" may be only a campaign to raise public awarenesNext, CHRD wrote:
> In early 2018, officials in Xinjiang declared that they had met almost all the goals in the government’s anti-terror campaigns in presenting the Xinjiang government’s 2017 “work report” at the National People’s Congress annual session.

This may imply that the officials have announced that they locked up suspected extremists. However, the cited source does not talk about extremism or re-education at all. It talks about the economic development of Xinjiang.
