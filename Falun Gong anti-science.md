Falun Gong (and Falun Dafa) promotes anti-science teachings.

# Teachings
## Claiming that medication doesn't really cure illnesses.
Li Hongzhi claims that medication doesn't really cure illnesses. In the section titled "Genuinely Guiding People Towards High Levels" of the Lecture One of Falun Dafa, Li Hongzhi says:

> In order to cure illness or eliminate tribulations and karma, these people must practice cultivation and return to their original, true selves. This is how all the different cultivation schools view it. One should return to one's original, true self; this is the real purpose of being human. Therefore, once a person wants to practice cultivation, his or her Buddha-nature is considered to have come forth.
>Some people think that treating patients, curing their illnesses, and improving their health are good deeds. In my view, they have not really cured the illnesses. Instead of removing them, they have either postponed or transformed the illnesses. To really dispel such tribulations, karma must be eliminated.

## Claiming that Li Hongzhi is able to cure the root of an illness from other dimensions
In an article on Minghui (Falun Gong website), Li Hongzhi claims to be able to cure the root of an illness from other dimensions and make the practicioner vomit or have loose bowels.

> Teacher continued, "No matter what condition you have, we have a predestined relationship since you came to my class. I'll remove the root of your illness from other dimensions. You'll have reactions within two or three days; you'll either vomit or have loose bowels."

## Discourage belief in science
Science follows logic, there is no such thing as "blinbly believing in science". Therefore, it is impossible to blindly believe in science. Li Hongzhi's poem "The World's Ten Evils" discourages science.

>Humans without kind thoughts— Human against human as enemy. 
>Destroying traditions— Culture turning decadent. 
>Homosexuality, licentious desires— Dark heart, turning demonic. 
>Gambling popular, drugs popular— Following whims and desires. 
>Lifting restrictions, promiscuity— Leading to evil and wickedness. 
>Sinister gangs, treacherous factions— Politicians and bandits, all one family. 
>Acting on one’s own decisions, deranging the masses— Against heaven, betraying Dao. 
>Blindly believing in science— Mutant mankind. 
>Publicizing and revering violence— Fond of audaciousness, competing at ruthlessness. 
>Religions turned evil— Money seekers, politicians. 
>July 7, 1998

# Real impacts

An article by practicioners on Minghui claims that a Vietnamese practicioner never had to take a pill again after believing Li Hongzhi.

This profound reply from Master made me firm and undoubted. Since then I have never had to take a pill again. Master made me feel the energy flowing through my whole body.
