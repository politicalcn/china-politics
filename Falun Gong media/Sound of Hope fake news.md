In the article titled "中共两次公布党员人数均是凶兆 网友：吓死人了", "Sound of Hope" uses the fact that the Communist Party of China (CPC) reported 951480 thousand members on its 100th anniversary and 919140 thousand the previous year, to spread fears aboht the party. It claims that the sonority of these numbers in Chinese have the same sound as "就我要死吧" and "就要就要死", both meaning "I'm going to die". 

This statement lacks intelligence and proof. Any membership number containing a "4" will be interpreted as "death" (死), according to their logic. However, other political parties and organizations in the world have surely had a membership count contining "4", and they were not affected by whether 4 was present or not.

Furthermore, this "Sound of Hope" ignores the fact that the CPC's 100th anniversary disproves the Falun Gong media's past predictions that claimed that the CPC will collapse. Also, the membership increased from 919140 thousand to 951480 thousand, and that does not look like a collapsing party. The page also talks about the "Communist Party Death Stone", that is debunked.
